# SQL_DataAnalysisProject1
Use publicly available data to analyze car accident data including loading in local csv files using MySQL, populating tables, using both built in and user defined functions, data profiling the tables and extracting key pieces of information from the tables.

These were run on Kat's local laptop in order of their numbering in mySQL. Data and project inspired by https://github.com/ptyadana/SQL-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Projects/tree/master/Database%20Clinics%20-%20MySQL repository.
